# **Lexical-401**

*An unauthorized library of nodes, plugins, and more for Metaâ€™s [Lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical) framework*

**An unauthorized library?**

Yes. I had to extend Lexical in a couple of ways and thought it might be fun to share. 

But, there's nowhere to collect unofficial Lexical things right now, so I thought I'd throw this together. I may be the only one to use it, but you're welcome to contribute. If Meta decides to do something official, I'd be happy to send what's here there. 

For now, this seemed helpful. 
And who doesn't love the *unauthorized*? 

Exactly. No one.

**What's your project?**

I'd like to help people collaborate with AI in order to tell better stories online. 

Hope to have more to say about that later. For now, enjoy the library. 

**How do I add something?**

- Make a Pull Request with your node(s), plugin(s), etc...
- It'd be great if you added a small README with docs and code sandbox. 
- Name, rank, and serial number at the bottom would be even better than that! 

**What about updating what's already here?**

Good question. I don't rightly know. This is a bare bones operation. There are no tests, no build processes, no `npm` anythings. Maybe that'll change at some point. In the meantime, you could contact the original author with questions or Pull Request a new version. 

Mostly, though, I imagine you'll use this code to whip up your own thing.

**What if this overwhelms you?**

What are we talking? Cats and dogs living together? I guess I'll have to re-evaluate the wisdom of my choices. 

But for now, what could possibly go wrong?

**Can I contact you?**

I'm generally at abelsj60@gmail.com.
